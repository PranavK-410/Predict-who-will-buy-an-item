The dataset contains different age groups who buy certain cosmetic product.</br>
The information about a person such as age group, gender, income, etc. is considered to see whether that age group (to which the person belongs to) will buy the product or not?</br></br>
Decision Tree makes use of <b>information Gain</b> or <b>Gini Index</b> to select an attribute which has highest information gain or lowest entropy as root node of the tree. It then recursively calculates IG for all other attributes to form a tree.</br></br>
In this program I have calculated <b>Gini Index</b> to select attribute and form a tree. It then ultimately predicts which age group will buy the product or not.</br>
</br><b>NOTE:</b> You will have to download <b>graphviz</b> to display the tree. Once you download graphviz you have to restart the PC & then you are good to go.
